          <h1>Grin and Dandy are the comedy duo, George Dimarelos and Demi Yeraki.</h1>
          <p><em>An unlikely pairing of a long-time straight-ahead standup and a mostly coherent multimedia wild child, George and Demi met doing improv (for different reasons) in 2022. They've since collaborated on several comedy shows in Australia and one in the UK, one world circuiting short film, an over-extended commitment to improv theatre in the month of July 2023 and of course, many draft scripts, sound (f)art projects and jokes in progress. Grin and Dandy is the formalisation of this collaboration debuting in 2026. About time, they reckon.</em></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>GEORGE (curly hair) began performing standup comedy in Sydney in 2011. He has since performed all around the world, including London, Edinburgh, New York and Kuala Lumpur. He is also an actor, with his favourite recent credits including Apple TV+’s Time Bandits and a very widely broadcast commercial with a singing deck.</p>
          <p>DEMI (fringe/bangs if you are an american) is an about town doodler, design-guy and improviser. She loves world music, experimental animations and short poems. She awaits your passionate email about any of these things and will reply with drawings. </p>
          <p>Demi is known to George for curating the Grin and Dandy workshop space. If you want to come visit for a creative workshop, with your lover, friend or company team, please just drop us a line. Really, she is a bit lonely. Though George is great company. Yes, she is the one writing this.</p>
          <p>George and Demi live together in a one bedroom apartment that really only has enough space for one person and not a day goes by where someone doesn't laugh so hard they snort or fart so hard they cry. They both love to read and cartwheel. George writing now: Wow, ok I was not ready for this. Thank you for reading this far, and… uh. Keep on keeping on.</p>
          <p>Demi back again here to say, George had a really cool expression on his face while writing that, kind of he was overjoyed that you, specifically, read this to the end.</p>
          <p>“I agree with that intepretation of my facial expression, but we've really got to work on our show now,” says George.</p>
          <p><em>They are currently working on their debut theatrical sketch show, "Chomsky and Foucault", inspired by a good bit of philosophy and a bad bit of contemporary world affairs. It opens Monday March 30 2026. </p></em>
